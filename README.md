# The Gaming Room

## The Gaming Room Client and Their Software Requirements:

Client: The client is "The Gaming Room."\\
Software Requirement: They wanted to transform "Draw It or Lose It," an Android-only game, into a web-based application to broaden its accessibility. The game should be compatible across multiple platforms, including desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. The core structure of the game, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn, should be retained. Each game, team, and player should have a unique identifier.

## What Did You Do Particularly Well in Developing This Documentation?

The document is well-structured, with clear sections that detail the executive summary, requirements, design constraints, domain model, evaluation, and recommendations. The use of design patterns like Singleton and Iterator is highlighted, and the evaluation section provides a comprehensive analysis of different operating platforms.

## What About the Process of Working Through a Design Document Did You Find Helpful When Developing the Code?

Working through a design document provides a clear roadmap for development. It helps in understanding the client's requirements, setting clear goals, and ensuring that the software aligns with the intended design and functionality. It also aids in foreseeing potential challenges and planning solutions in advance.

## If You Could Choose One Part of Your Work on These Documents to Revise, What Would You Pick? How Would You Improve It?

One potential area for revision could be the "System Architecture View" section. It currently serves as a placeholder or reminder. In a revision, a detailed system and subsystem architecture, including physical components or tiers, could be added to provide a clearer picture of the software's architecture.

## How Did You Interpret the User’s Needs and Implement Them into Your Software Design?

The user's needs were interpreted based on the requirements provided by The Gaming Room. The design focused on broadening accessibility, maintaining the game's core structure, and ensuring unique identifiers. It's crucial to consider the user's needs to ensure the software is user-friendly, meets their expectations, and provides a seamless experience.

## Why is it so Important to Consider the User’s Needs When Designing?

Considering the user's needs ensures that the software is relevant, user-friendly, and meets the intended purpose. It enhances user satisfaction, increases engagement, and ensures the software's success in the market.

## How Did You Approach Designing Software? What Techniques or Strategies Would You Use in the Future to Analyze and Design a Similar Software Application?

The approach involved understanding the client's requirements, evaluating different platforms, and recommending technologies and design patterns. In the future, techniques like user interviews, prototyping, iterative design, and user testing could be employed to ensure the software meets user needs and expectations.
